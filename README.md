###Description of the application:
This application is the landing page of the Horiseon digital marketing company. It has working navigation and fulfills accessibility thanks to semantic HTML elements and alt attributes for every image and icon. 
The CSS selectors have been consolidated to the best of my ability and all divs have been changed more definitive elements.
